# FAQ

<details>

<summary><strong>Why create a new platform instead of improving Discord?</strong></summary>

While Discord is great for real-time chatting, it lacks **on-chain functionality, governance-specific tools, and structured discussion design**. These missing elements make it unsuitable for **long-term, transparent governance** within the Cardano ecosystem. SovX is purpose-built to bridge that gap.

<details>

<summary><strong>How can smaller DReps or SPOs make their voices heard?</strong></summary>

SovX introduces a **Spotlight mechanism** that periodically and randomly highlights DReps and SPOs, inviting them to share their views. This ensures **fair visibility** across the ecosystem — not just for the most influential representatives.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Does every comment or post have to be recorded on-chain?</strong></summary>

No. Users can freely choose whether to **publish content on-chain or off-chain**, lowering the barrier to participation. On-chain content is marked with a special indicator and given **priority visibility** to emphasize transparency and accountability.

<details>

<summary><strong>If voting results are already public, why do we still need this platform?</strong></summary>

Voting data shows **how many people supported or opposed** a proposal — but not **why**. SovX provides **dedicated discussion spaces for each proposal**, allowing the community and proposers to capture reasoning, identify points of contention, and build genuine consensus.

<details>

<summary><strong>What is the purpose of personal posts or articles?</strong></summary>

Personal posts allow **DReps, SPOs, ADA holders, and researchers** to publicly express their perspectives or analyses, forming a **transparent governance record**. This enhances accountability and helps ADA holders make **better-informed delegation decisions**.

</details>

<details>

<summary><strong>Will this platform just become another fragmented forum?</strong></summary>

No. SovX’s strength lies in its **on-chain integration** and **auto-generated discussion spaces** for every proposal, ensuring governance conversations remain organized and accessible. The platform is not meant to replace existing communities — it aims to become the **default arena for Cardano governance dialogue**.
