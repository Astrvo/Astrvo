# Astrvo Engine Unity SDK

The Astrvo platform will later launch a Unity-based SDK: **Astrvo Engine**, enabling any developer to build their own Cardano-native 3D spaces like assembling building blocks, without having to start from scratch on complex tasks such as character systems, interactions, user authentication, multiplayer synchronization, wallet integration, or on-chain logic.

Astrvo Engine Unity SDK is an open-source toolkit including the core engine, an online space demo, and full documentation.\
As an MVP, it will act as foundational infrastructure for SocialFi and GameFi applications, validating the value of “lowering the barrier to 3D DApp development” and injecting new creative energy into the Cardano ecosystem.

### Core Features of Astrvo Engine Unity SDK

#### 1. Core Engine & Architecture

* A highly modular Unity project structure with clean separation of logic, UI, and networking layers.

#### 2. Prefab-Based SDK Components

* **Wallet Component:** One-click integration of CIP-30 wallet login, signing, and transaction actions.
* **Identity Component:** Retrieve user addresses, ADA balances, Cardano Native Tokens, and NFT metadata via a simple API.
* **UI Component Library:** A set of UI prefabs styled for Cardano-aligned DApp experiences.
* **User Login Component:** Instant generation of login UI and user authentication flows.
* **Multiplayer Interaction Component:** One-click server/client deployment with real-time multiplayer, voice chat, and networked interactions.
* **Decentralized Storage Component:** Tools for uploading and serving assets via Iagon or other Cardano-aligned decentralized storage options.

#### 3. Example Project & Documentation

* A fully functional online space demo built entirely with the SDK.
* A complete developer documentation website covering installation, usage, and deployment.<br>
