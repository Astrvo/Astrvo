# Catalyst Voting

I removed the navigation links you pasted because they're part of site navigation, not the main page content.

I can convert a full page into GitBook-optimized Markdown (using tabs, steppers, FAQ expandables, etc.). Please paste the page content you want converted (or upload the HTML/Markdown), and I’ll transform it per the rules you gave.
