# What is Astrvo?

**Astrvo** is a decentralized 3D social platform built on **Cardano**, designed to give users, **DReps**, and **Stake Pool Operators (SPOs)** a transparent and censorship-resistant space to share ideas, record updates, and engage in open governance. It serves as a living public record of Cardano’s community voices, where every opinion, discussion, and decision is preserved on-chain, empowering true digital sovereignty and accountability.

In the Web3 world, community interaction is still largely limited to text and chat channels. Platforms like Spatial.io offer visual immersion, but they lack true connections to blockchain identity, on-chain assets, and governance actions.

Astrvo is designed to build a 3D virtual platform natively tied to the Cardano blockchain, enabling communities, brands, and projects to establish a “spatial” presence in a decentralized environment.

During the MVP stage, the first real-world deployment is the Snek Taiwan offline meetup, where Astrvo provides an interactive experience that combines **on-chain identity + virtual venue + project showcases**.
